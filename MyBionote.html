					<p class="txt"><b><i>Rowell Clint Valera</i></b> is a very kind person, friendly and a loving son towards his family. He sees goodness in others and he want to spread positivity in every possible way so that everyone around him will feel happy and better. And seeing his loved ones happy, is the best feeling for him.</p>
					<p class="align">He entered college taking the course mechanical engineering at the University of the East-Manila but it turned out that the course
					he took wasn't for him. A lot has changed after the 1st semester of his college year. He was devasted, unmotivated and lost on his track. He experienced too many failures in his life but his determination to be successful pushed him to be better every single day. He kept on going, turning those failures to lessons, and that lessons turned into oppurtunities. He continued the path of taking the engineering course but this time, he finally found the right course for him where he considered it as a new beginnig, BS in computer engineering
					He is now a 3rd year college student, a very positive student and more motivated than ever. He is also currently assigned as the Vice president of student affairs to the organization of society of computer engineering students (SCPES).</p>
